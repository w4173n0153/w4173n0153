- Hi, I’m @w4173n0153.
- I’m interested in cybersecurity, cryptography and network engineering.
- I’m currently learning JavaScript for Node.js.
- I’m not looking for anyone to help me out at the moment, and I'm not going to collaborate with someone.
- I'm not disrespecting your attention.
- I'm very pleased with you who reads this and goes through my main page. Althrough I've never wanted any attention on myself, 
- I'm pleased that you're paying me it.
- I'm a lone warrior who doesn't need any backup so far.
- I'm not going to look for someone to help me, althrough I'll find someone to help me one day if I feel that I need it.
- I'm sorry if you wanted to work with me, but everything can be solved by negotiating.
- I'm ready to talk with you at any time in my telegram: @white_nois
- I'm really enjoying seeing and listening to video and audio interference.
- I HATE EMOJI
